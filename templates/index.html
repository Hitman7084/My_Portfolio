<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
<p>
    Hello there! My name is Himanshu Mall and this is the first page for my portfolio website.
    From here you can see my projects as well as about me ðŸ˜Š.

    I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), 
    and as it turns out, See's Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the 
    simplest of their wee confection offerings. I bought two chocolate lollipops and two 
    chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was four-something. I mean, the candies were
    tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents. After this dollar-per-candy 
    revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any time soon.
    The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore those scars with 
    pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it 
    character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in 
    its prime and it knew it.
